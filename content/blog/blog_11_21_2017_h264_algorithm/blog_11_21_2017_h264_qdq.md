#### __Introduction__
***

Each residual macroblock is transformed, quantized and coded. Previous standards such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and H.263 made use of the 8x8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as the basic transform. The “baseline” profile of H.264 uses three transforms depending on the type of residual data that is to be coded: a transform for the 4x4 array of luma DC coefficients in intra macroblocks (predicted in 16x16 mode), a transform for the 2x2 array of chroma DC coefficients (in any macroblock) and a transform for all other 4x4 blocks in the residual data. If the optional “adaptive block size transform” mode is used, further transforms are chosen depending on the motion compensation block size (4x8, 8x4, 8x8, 16x8, etc).

#### __Coefficient Scan Order__

#### __4x4 DCT & IDCT__
***

The 2-D DCT could be represented as 

$Y=AXA^T$

which could be transformed as:

Thus DCT could be represented as:

$Y=CXC^T \bigotimes E$

The IDCT could be represented as:

$X^{\prime}=C^T(Y \bigotimes E)C$

The H264 DCT only perform the $CXC^T$ part, leave the $\bigotimes E$ be deal with in Quant and Dequant stage.

#### __Quantization__
***

[Quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)), in mathematics and digital signal processing, is the process of mapping input values from a large set (often a continuous set) to output values in a (countable) smaller set. Rounding and truncation are typical examples of quantization processes. Quantization is involved to some degree in nearly all digital signal processing, as the process of representing a signal in digital form ordinarily involves rounding. Quantization also forms the core of essentially all lossy compression algorithms.

The difference between an input value and its quantized value (such as round-off error) is referred to as quantization error. A device or algorithmic function that performs quantization is called a quantizer. An analog-to-digital converter is an example of a quantizer. 

Quantization is a very important step in data compression. For H264:

$Z = round(Y/Q_{step})$

Y is coefficients of the transform described above, Z is the quantized coefficient. H264 provided 52 values of Qstep, which are indexed by a Quantization Index, QP. Qstep increase by 12.5% for increment of 1 in QP and Qstep doubles in size for every increment of 6 in QP. QP chroma is derived from QP y so QP chroma is less than QP y for value of QP y above 30.

Assume $W=CXC^T$, then $Z_{ij} = round(W_{ij} \frac{PF}{Q_{step}})$ The PF is the value of matrix $E$, whose value depending on the position $(i,j)$

To simplify the calculation, and enlarge the dynamic range, let's assume $\frac{MF}{2^{qbits}}=\frac{PF}{Qstep}$ where $qbits=15+floor(QP/6)$ Then:

$Z_{ij} = round(W_{ij} \frac{MF}{2^{qbits}}) = (W_{ij}MF + f)>>qbits$ 

The MF is pre-calculated table as followed. For QP>5, the factores MF remain unchaged but the divisor $2^{qbits}$ increased by a factor of 2 for each increment of 6 in QP.

#### __Dequantization__
***

According to previous chapter, the process of inverse transform is $X^{\prime}=C^T(Y \bigotimes E)C$. Then the inverse quantization is:

$X^{\prime}_{ij}=Z_{ij}*Qstep*PF*64$

Let $V=Qstep * PF *64$, which is also defined as pre-calculated table for $0 \eqslantless QP \eqslantless 5$

$W^{\prime}_{ij} = Z_{ij}*V_{ij}*2^{floor(QP/6)}$

The table of V:
